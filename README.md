### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Samuel
#### Full-Stack Developer

I am a developer who likes to work on side-projects in my spare time. Learning new things has always been a hobby of mine, and nobody should ever get comfortable with their current level of knowledge on any subject.  I don't believe developers should ever stop learning and building things.

If you're not striving to get ahead, you are falling behind. 

Skills: C#/Angular/HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery/SQL
